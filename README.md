### GREETINGS FELLOW HUMAN

My name is Michael. After I finished my apprenticeship to become an electrical engineer at the german airforce I started a second one at SUSE in Nürnberg to become a programmer and to get better with linux.
My current favourite language is go and I like to programm Arduino sketches. If it really has to be I may do some python (or even C++) but I try to avoid it. 

* I’m currently working on https://github.com/uyuni-project/inter-server-sync (as mmuschner) and sometimes a bit of webdev with go
* I'm currently learning go, postgresql, protobuf, webdev, security
* I speak german and english (maybe soon also dutch)
* How to reach me: michael.muschner@mailbox.org

## My skills

* Linux 
* Electrical stuff and arduino
* A bit of networking
* Go
* Python
* Git 
* Postgresql
